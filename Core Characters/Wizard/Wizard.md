- **Age:** Mid-to-late 20s
- **Heritage:** Primarily human with slight elven ancestry (approximately a quarter elf). His elven traits include a tall and scrawny build, slightly tapered ears, and an inability to grow a full beard.
- **Background:** The first in his family to become a wizard, breaking away from a lineage of hardworking, non-magical humans. His great-grandfather, an elf, left his homeland for a better life, starting as a farmer and elevating the family to middle-class stability over generations.

#### **Personality:**

- **Charming Overthinker:** Naturally outgoing and charismatic but riddled with insecurities, especially in personal matters. He’s the “ideas guy,” brimming with creativity and quick thinking, but his overthinking often leads to paralysis or self-sabotage.
- **Emotionally Volatile:** His elven heritage might explain his emotional swings, shifting rapidly between joy, frustration, and melancholy. While this sets him apart from the even-tempered humans around him, it’s rarely an issue—except in dating, where it complicates his efforts to connect.

    - **Procrastination:** His tendency to delay unpleasant tasks, like certifications needed for career advancement, keeps him stuck in his current job.

#### **Life Goals:**

- **Ultimate Goal:** To find love. However, his overthinking, shyness, and insecurities push this aspiration aside as he focuses on becoming "established" enough to feel worthy of a meaningful relationship.
- **Career Aspirations:** Reaching a point of self-employment and personal comfort. He views his career as a means to an end rather than a passion, valuing stability over ambition.

- **Selina (Ex):** A mix of bitterness and lingering attraction complicates his efforts to move forward. She unintentionally pushes his buttons, highlighting his insecurities.
- **Grim (Dwarf Friend):** A mentor-like figure with a gruff exterior who offers blunt advice. Their contrasting outlooks spark both comedic and heartfelt interactions.
