- **Age:** Mid 30s (young by dwarven standards, but old enough to feel jaded)
- **Race/Class:** Dwarf Artificer
- **Background:**  
    Grim comes from a long line of traditional dwarven blacksmiths and craftspeople, but he never quite fit into the mold. Rejecting his family’s expectations to work in forges or mines, he pursued his passion for intricate engravings and rune-crafting. Eventually, he opened _The Forged Tankard_, a cozy bar where he also showcases his craftsmanship. Though outwardly gruff, Grim uses his bar as a haven for misfits like himself, secretly taking pride in creating a community space.
