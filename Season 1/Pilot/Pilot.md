### **Pilot Episode: "Dungeon Overtime"**

---

#### **Act 1: Setting Up the Night**

- **Opening at Work (World-Building and Stakes):**
    
    - The wizard is at his desk in the "corporate wizard tower" office, hurriedly closing tabs and muttering about wrapping up before Mira’s performance. The office is a magical-modern hybrid, with mundane tasks like email alerts paired with glowing runic keyboards and floating monitors.
    - **On the Phone with Mira:** The wizard reassures Mira, boosting her confidence about her first performance since her breakup. He promises to be there no matter what, setting up his internal stakes for the evening.
    - **The Cleric’s Call:** As the wizard is rushing to leave, the cleric calls to say he’s waiting in the parking lot. The wizard misses an important notification about a potential issue on his work’s support system—a detail the audience glimpses but he does not.

- **Travel Sequence (Character Dynamics):**
    
    - The wizard hops into the cleric’s car. They discuss the wizard’s plan to ask Mira out, revealing his overthinking and nervous energy. The cleric is skeptical, warning him it might be too soon after her breakup. Their conversation establishes their dynamic: the cleric’s cautious, rule-following nature versus the wizard’s impulsive schemes.
    - The wizard insists this is the night, brushing aside doubts about his lingering feelings for Selina.

#### **Act 2: The Bar and the Disruption**

- **Introduction of the Bar and Characters:**
    
    - At Grim’s bar, Mira greets the wizard enthusiastically, hugging him and sending him into a flustered, stammering mess. Grim and the cleric exchange knowing laughs in the background.
    - Mira thanks everyone for their support and leaves to prepare for her performance. Grim teases the wizard about his plan, emphasizing the number of times his previous schemes have fallen apart.

- **The Magical Pager Alert:**
    
    - Just as Mira is about to take the stage, the wizard’s "magical pager" buzzes with a work emergency. He groans, realizing he’s the on-call support wizard.
    - The wizard frantically explains the situation to Grim and promises to return before Mira finishes her set. The cleric, reluctantly, agrees to drive him back to the office.

#### **Act 3: Enter the Dungeon**

- **Frantic Drive Back (Comedy and Character):**
    
    - The wizard panics as the cleric sticks to the speed limit, refusing to bend the rules. Their bickering highlights their contrasting personalities, with the wizard finally convincing the cleric to slightly exceed the limit.

- **Breaking Into the Tower:**
    
    - Arriving at the office, the wizard realizes he’s forgotten his keycard. Thinking on his feet, he recalls an open window in the ground-floor canteen.
    - The cleric hesitates but is guilt-tripped into helping the wizard break in, grumbling about the illegality of it all. They squeeze through the window in a comical sequence, setting up the dungeon transition.

- **Office Transforms Into Dungeon:**
    
    - As they step inside, the building’s after-hours enchantments activate, turning it into a mini fantasy dungeon. Cubicles shift into maze-like barriers, enchanted filing cabinets roam, and the vending machine at the canteen turns hostile.
    - The wizard and cleric realize they must navigate the dungeon to reach the server room and resolve the issue.

#### **Act 4: The Dungeon Crawl**

- **Obstacles and Monsters (Action and Comedy):**
    
    1. **Cubicle Maze with Filing Minotaurs:**  
        Shifting walls and animated filing cabinets trap them in a maze. The cleric’s light spell reveals a hidden path, while the wizard casts a “Dispel Bureaucracy” spell to pacify the minotaurs.
    2. **Boardroom of Eternal Meetings:**  
        A time-loop spell traps a phantom meeting of office spirits endlessly rehashing buzzwords. The cleric uses his patience and understanding of ritual to adjourn the meeting, breaking the spell.
    3. **Canteen Chimera:**  
        A monstrous amalgamation of leftover food attacks. The wizard blasts it with a fire spell, while the cleric uses a purification spell to solidify the mana pudding core, defeating it.


- **The Wizard’s Desk (Humor and Frustration):**
    
    - The wizard finally reaches his desk and logs into his “magic computer,” deactivating most of the dungeon. However, he discovers the problem stems from the missed notification earlier.
    - To fully resolve the issue, they must go to the basement server room, where the “arcane firewall” has become unstable.

---

#### **Act 5: Climax and Consequences**

- **Server Room Boss Battle:**
    
    - The server manifests as a fire-and-circuit elemental, spawning error sprites that attack. The wizard’s spells weaken it, but the cleric’s hidden talent (e.g., knot-tying) saves the day, binding loose magical wires to stabilize the firewall.
    - They banish the elemental, resolve the support ticket, and reset the building to its normal state.

- **Rushing Back to the Bar:**
    
    - The wizard and cleric rush back, barely catching the end of Mira’s performance. The wizard tries to apologize, but Mira brushes it off, saying she’s just glad he made it.

- **Introduction of Darius (Emotional Gut Punch):**
    
    - Mira introduces Darius, who reconnected with her during the performance break. He’s charming, confident, and everything the wizard isn’t. 
    - Mira thanks the wizard for being such a good friend and says she thinks she's ready to start dating again, and that Darius has asked her out for a coffee later in the week. 
    - She finishes by thanking the wizard for all his emotional support, and that if it wasn't for him, she'd still be sitting at home on the couch being sad, and how he's such a good friend to her

- **Closing Scene (Bittersweet and Funny):**
    
    - The wizard, dejected, tightens his jaw and says, “That’s what friends are for.”
    - Back at the bar, Grim and the cleric console the wizard with teasing but supportive banter. The episode ends with the trio laughing at the absurdity of the night, setting the tone for the series.
