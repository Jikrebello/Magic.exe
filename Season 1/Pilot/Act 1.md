INT. CORPORATE WIZARD TOWER - EVENING

We open to the end of day at a magical-modern office. Employees are bunching up and standing around their cubicles, their enchanted floating monitors shutting down as people chat about their plans for the weekend. A few coffee cups hover midair in a line, floating in the direction of the office kitchen sink.  We can see people chat on the balcony outside, winding down and chatting before they knock off. The camera pans to WIZARD (mid-20s, scrawny, slightly elven features), hunched over his desk, hurriedly typing a message into his terminal.  The screen shows glowing open runic terminal tabs, rune editors and chat notifications. He's muttering to himself a summary of the days work, clicks on a glowing green button, and then starts closing magical "tabs" on his monitor.

WIZARD
(to himself, muttering)
Just gotta wrap this up... nothing else... please no last-minute disasters.

His PHONE buzzes. Wizard picks it up and starts pacing.

His RUNIC KEYBOARD glows as he types furiously. A NOTIFICATION blinks in the corner of his screen: "URGENT: SUPPORT SYSTEM ISSUE." He doesn’t notice.

WIZARD
(into phone)
Hey, Mira. Yeah, I’ll be there. Of course! You’re gonna do great, okay? First gig since the breakup—it’s huge!

INTERCUT: MIRA (mid-20s, half-elf bard, confident but nervous) is backstage at GRIM’S BAR. She clutches her glowing lute and bites her lip.

MIRA
Thanks... I mean, it’s scary. Aaron—he was always the one pushing me to perform. Now it’s just... me.

WIZARD
You’ve got this. Look, getting out there is half the battle. You’re amazing. Everyone knows it—you just need to remind yourself.

Mira smiles softly, reassured.

MIRA
You better be there.

WIZARD
I’ll be front row.

Another PHONE BUZZ interrupts. Wizard glances at the screen: "Cleric." He panics slightly.

WIZARD
(into phone)
Gotta go! Break a leg!

He switches the line.

WIZARD
(into phone, hurriedly)
Hey, Cleric! Yeah, I’m coming down. Just give me two minutes.

CLERIC (mid-20s, meticulous and reserved) is sitting in a tidy car, parked in the CORPORATE TOWER LOT. He adjusts his glasses and looks at his watch.

CLERIC
Two minutes. Not three.

BACK TO WIZARD

Wizard slams the phone down and frantically grabs his BAG and WAND. As he moves, the camera lingers on the flashing "SUPPORT SYSTEM ISSUE" notification on his monitor. He misses it entirely.

INT. CORPORATE WIZARD TOWER - VARIOUS AREAS - CONTINUOUS

The camera follows Wizard as he rushes through the office. The building is a hybrid of corporate and magical aesthetics: open-plan cubicles with glowing partitions, enchanted plants that shimmer faintly, and a floating coffee cart in the cafeteria.

Wizard waves goodbye to a COWORKER, who levitates a stack of enchanted documents.

WIZARD
Later, Vance! Don’t let the spreadsheets bite.

He sprints into an elevator. The glowing runes on the walls light up as the doors close.

EXT. CORPORATE TOWER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Wizard bursts out the front doors, nearly tripping over his untied shoelaces. Cleric is waiting in a neat, modest sedan. He waves calmly as Wizard throws his bag into the back seat and hops in.

INT. CLERIC’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

The contrast between the two is clear. Wizard is a bundle of nervous energy; Cleric is calm and composed, his car meticulously clean.

WIZARD
Thanks for the lift, man. You’re a lifesaver.

CLERIC
(starts driving)
Why not just take your broom? It’s faster.

WIZARD
(stammers)
Uh, minor enchantment issue... thing’s stuck on reverse.

Cleric raises an eyebrow but doesn’t push further.

WIZARD
Anyway… tonight’s the night.

CLERIC
(flatly)
Oh no.

WIZARD
(ignoring him)
It’s been long enough. Mira’s finally over Aaron. I’ve planned this out. After her set, I’m gonna ask her out.

CLERIC
(skeptical)
And this won’t end like the last five times you had a “plan”?

WIZARD
Hey, those were dry runs. Tonight is the real thing.

CLERIC
(stern but kind)
She just got out of a relationship. Maybe… let her breathe? Plus, you’re still hung up on Selina.

Wizard groans dramatically.

WIZARD
Relationships aren’t clean-cut, man. It’s complicated. But trust me… tonight’s the night.

Cleric sighs but says nothing, focusing on the road. The car cruises under glowing streetlights, passing magical billboards advertising enchanted energy drinks and potion delivery services.

FADE OUT.
