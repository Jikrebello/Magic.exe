### **Magical Internet & Tech**

1. **Spellwriting as Code:**
    
    - Wizards work as spell developers, debugging "incantation loops" and crafting enchantments for applications like spell-streaming, magical mapping, and summoning services.
    - Typos in spellwriting can cause literal disasters:
        - Missing a semicolon could summon a gremlin that wreaks havoc until fixed.
        - Poorly optimized spells might "lag," freezing objects or slowing time around them.
2. **Magical Browsing:**
    
    - The equivalent of search engines involves summoning a spectral librarian who provides answers (sometimes outdated or sarcastic).
    - Popup ads manifest as tiny pixies that buzz around users until dismissed or zapped with a dispelling charm.
3. **Social Media (Proto-MySpace):**
    
    - "RuneBoards" are glowing enchanted tablets where users inscribe personal messages, photos, and spells.
    - Overuse leads to "energy drain" where users’ magical aura dims temporarily.
4. **Gaming:**
    
    - Arcade machines channel small amounts of magic from the user to power enchantments, creating immersive holographic dungeon runs.
    - Multiplayer games involve summoning projections of avatars to duel in real-time.
5. **Viruses and Bugs:**
    
    - Magical malware can corrupt devices, turning them into mischievous constructs like enchanted refrigerators or hostile vacuums.
    - IT wizards might double as adventurers, purging "server dungeons" of rogue programs that have become sentient.

### **D&D-Inspired Corporations**

1. **Dragon CEOs:**
    
    - Dragons hoard both gold and data, serving as overbearing tech moguls running companies like "Scalemail" (a secure magical mail service) or "HoardDrive" (a premium storage platform where everything costs extra).
    - Their greed often leads to corporate rivalries, like dragons spying on each other’s hoards or launching magical DDOS (Destructive Dragon-Originated Sorcery) attacks.
2. **Goblins in Logistics:**
    
    - Goblins run chaotic delivery services (like _Gobazon_), where parcels arrive scorched, cursed, or with minor enchantments due to careless handling.
    - Their motto: “Fast, Cheap, Chaotic.” Employees include sarcastic goblin drivers and unhelpful customer service imps.
3. **Beholder Consultants:**
    
    - Beholders specialize in "multi-tasking" and offer expensive consulting services for startups.
    - Their eyestalks serve as cameras for corporate surveillance, making them both invaluable and terrifying bosses.
4. **Corporate Hierarchy Parody:**
    
    - Trolls run middle management, famous for gatekeeping everything from office supplies to promotions.
    - Elves dominate PR, creating pristine marketing campaigns that often overpromise and underdeliver.
    - Tieflings in HR try to manage inter-office "curses" and disputes between magical species.

### **Nostalgic Magical Tech**

1. **Entertainment Devices:**
    
    - Enchanted VHS tapes replay events from the past. A "rewind spell" allows users to relive or alter minor details in their playback (sparking ethical dilemmas).
    - "Orb Screens" are the magical equivalent of flat-screens, projecting vibrant illusions for TV shows, games, and news.
2. **Communication Devices:**
    
    - Landline crystals function as magical phones but require users to carve their contact runes for each call.
    - Fax Machines act as small teleportation devices, sending physical items instantly but often with hilarious mix-ups (e.g., letters merged into sandwiches).
3. **Transportation:**
    
    - Portal hubs at bus stops offer "express teleportation," but malfunctioning portals lead to misadventures in alternate dimensions.
    - Personal transportation includes enchanted scooters or spell-powered skateboards that sometimes develop quirky personalities.
4. **Household Appliances:**
    
    - Microwaves double as small alchemical labs, letting users brew potions in under a minute—but with the risk of explosions.
    - Magical cleaning tools (like enchanted brooms and dusters) are prone to unionizing if overworked.

### **Y2K Fantasy Culture**

1. **The Y2K Scare:**
    
    - The magical world is abuzz with rumors that ancient spells may stop working at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Eve.
    - Conspiracy theorists warn of doomsday events like summoned monsters or a catastrophic “magic overflow.”
2. **Pop Culture Trends:**
    
    - Magical boy bands enchant their performances, causing swooning spells among fans.
    - Enchanted "Tamagotchi Familiars" are all the rage, but neglecting them leads to them turning feral.
    - Fashion includes glamor charms to keep clothes clean or glowing runes embedded in retro-style sneakers.
3. **Economic Tensions:**
    
    - Small-town adventurers struggle to adapt to a world dominated by corporate-funded dungeon crawls.
    - Independent magic shops face stiff competition from chain stores run by liches with questionable ethics.
