**Premise:**  
The story centers on two mid-20s friends navigating their chaotic lives in a magical-tech world set in the nostalgic late 90s/early 2000s Y2K era. Modern conveniences are powered by magic, creating a quirky blend of early digital culture with D&D-inspired fantasy. Together, they tackle work, relationships, and personal growth while leaning on their unique friendship to survive escalating absurdity.

**Setting:**

- A _tech-driven magical city_ where classic D&D fantasy meets retro-modern design.
- The _internet is magical_, casting spells is akin to writing code, and corporations are run by monsters like dragons, beholders, and liches.
- Nostalgic tech, like box TVs, VHS tapes, and dial-up-style magic portals, adds charm to the setting.

**Themes:**

- _Friendship:_ The heart of the series is the platonic, supportive, and occasionally chaotic friendship between the wizard and the cleric.
- _Personal Growth:_ The characters grapple with their "edges" (personality traits) and learn to use them effectively, highlighting the balance between strength and flaw.
- _Mid-20s Struggles:_ Navigating careers, dating, and self-identity in a rapidly evolving magical-tech world.
- _Absurdity:_ Mundane problems spiral into epic, fantastical conflicts—while still grounded in relatable human struggles.

    - _Conflict:_ Struggles with fitting into the wizarding "developer" archetype and feels like an outsider among his peers.
    - _Role in Friendship:_ The planner and talker, often roping the cleric into schemes or overanalyzing situations.

    - _Personality:_ Kind-hearted, shy, and task-oriented, often second-guessing himself in social situations.
